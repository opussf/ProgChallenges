# Brackets

In a string containing any brackets (usually code) do all the brackets match in pairs?

# Task

Write a function `bool DoBracketsMatch( string )` that returns boolean if brackets match.
Because it refers to 'usually code', the assumption that they need to match in depth too is probably a good assumption.
