This persistance is how many times can you recursivly multipy all digits in a number together before the length of the result is 1 digit.

I.E.  for the number 77:
	77 = 7 * 7 = 49  (1)
	   = 4 * 9 = 36  (2)
	   = 3 * 6 = 18  (3)
	   = 8 * 1 = 8   (4)

# Objective....

Find the smallest integer with the highest persistance.

## Example

The videos above provide a number 277777788888899 as having a persistance of 11.
They also promote an idea of creating the numbers from the bottom up, makes most sense.
