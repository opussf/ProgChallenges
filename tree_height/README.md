# Tree Height

Given a charater C, and a height H, print a 'tree' with the body being height H.

For Example, C = "t" and H = 4, print:

│    t
│   t t
│  t t t
│ t t t t

Write a method `solution( C, H )` that prints the tree.

Assume that:
* C is a single printable character
* H is a positive integer

Bonus:
* Write as a function
