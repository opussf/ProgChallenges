# Max SubArray

Interview question from Unifi

Was told my attempted solution was the most unique seen.
I'm not sure if that is good or bad.

Goal is to take an array, and return the maxValue for any subArray.

Given:
[ -1, 0, 2, 3, 5, -20, 10, 11, -20 ]

Return the max value of the sum of any included sequence in the array.
