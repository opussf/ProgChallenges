# Tiling

Tile a set of smaller square into a larger one.

E.G. given one 3x3 square, three 2x2 squares, and four 1x1 squares, there are 32 unique ways to arrange them in a 5x5 square space.
Note: rotations and reflections are considered unique, swapping two NxN squares does not make a new tiling (squares aren't uniquely "colored").

How many tiling of a 30x30 square are there, given:
one 15x15, two 10x10, four 6x6, nine 5x5, then 3x3, three 2x2, and four 1x1 squares?
